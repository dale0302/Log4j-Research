## Log4j - Security Issue in the Supply Chain
### Abstract
The supply chain is extremely vulnerable to attacks and disruptions by internal and external threats. In this 
modern age, the industry depends greatly on a web of suppliers to manufacture their products, for both hardware 
and software, and these suppliers may also depend on their own web of suppliers. In the process, this jumbled 
mess of connections creates vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to attack a system. Due to layers of 
dependencies, it is difficult for companies to answer the question "how does an organization know that an attacker
has breached a vendor four connections away?" As a result, in recent years, supply chain vulnerabilities have 
become more common and have attracted public attention, such as SolarWinds, a company that provides monitoring 
services, and Log4j, an open-source logging library. For example, in 2020, attackers uploaded their malicious code 
into SolarWinds updates which users would unwittingly install into their system; while with Log4j, attackers found 
a flaw in the system that allowed them to break in and execute code remotely. While both examples were patched and 
fixed, organizations need to take a more proactive approach of verifying the supply chain, such as implementing a 
zero-trust architecture and more closely following the principles set by Saltzer & Schroeder and by doing so, 
prevent future damaging attacks.
